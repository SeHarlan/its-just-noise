“it's just noise” started as a personal challenge to make a long-form algorithm in under 100 lines of code. This constraint meant that I had to rely on basic building blocks, mainly Perlin noise (hence the name) but also some simple trignomic functions. 

As I got serious about fine-tuning and adding additional functionality like “banner mode” it ended up at around 200 lines of code, so not quite my original goal, but I'm gonna say it still qualifies as code minimalism ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Please enjoy and remember, it's just noise.

- Press "b" to re-generate in an banner apect ratio 
- Press "n" to generate brand new noise
